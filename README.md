<h1>Deploying Microsoft Sentinel</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>


In order to expedite the deployment process for Microsoft Sentinel, we will leverage the official Microsoft Solution known as [Sentinel all-in-one](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Tools/Sentinel-All-In-One). The release of Version 2 in April 2023 has significantly streamlined initial configuration tasks, offering enhanced features such as workspace retention settings, daily cap and commitment tiers, if required.

This deployment option also facilitates user and entity behavior analytics, leveraging pertinent identity information to detect and respond to advanced threats. Essentially, it serves as an integrated Microsoft Sentinel solution.

Moreover, the deployment option includes health diagnostics for analytics rules, data connectors, and automation rules to ensure the smooth operation of the Azure Sentinel Service. Notably, it installs the Content Hub solution, which comprises pre-configured packages of analytics, rules, dashboards, automation tasks, and other artifacts pertinent to Microsoft Sentinel.

Additionally, it enables data connectors from various sources including Azure Active Directory, Microsoft 365 Defender, and Threat intelligence platforms, facilitating immediate data ingestion from diverse sources.

Furthermore, the deployment option empowers analytics rules utilizing selected data connectors, with the ability to filter by severity.
